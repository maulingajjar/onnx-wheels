# onnx-wheels
To generate wheels for ONNX and ONNX Runtime which can be installed on ARM architectures, we will use Dockerâ€™s buildx functionality which enables building Docker images that work on multiple CPU architectures.

Docker buildx multi-architecture support can make use of either native builder nodes running on different architectures or the QEMU processor emulator. QEMU works by simulating all instructions of a foreign CPU instruction set on the host processor. Linux also has built-in support for running non-native binaries, called binfmt_misc which allows arbitrary executable file formats to be recognized and passed to such emulators.

# QEMU and binfmt-support
As an alternative to installing the QEMU and binfmt-support packages on your host system we will use a docker image to satisfy the corresponding requirements. Satisfy QEMU and binfmt-support requirements by running the following command:
```
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

Verify the entry in binfmt_misc by running the following command:
```
cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-arm
```

The output should look something like this:
```
enabled
interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
flags: F
offset 0
magic 7f454c4601010100000000000000000002002800
mask ffffffffffffff00fffffffffffffffffeffffff
```

# Generate CMake binaries
Run the following command to create a Docker image which will contain the CMake binaries that are required for building ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels:
```
docker buildx build -t cmake-binaries:3.20.5 -f cmake.multistage.Dockerfile .
```

# Generate ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels
To generate docker images containing ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels, run the following command after substituting proper values for the parameters:
```
docker buildx build \
       -t onnx-wheels:{ARCH}-{PY_VERSION} \
       -f onnx.Dockerfile \
       --build-arg ARCH={ARCH} \
       --build-arg PY_VERSION={PY_VERSION} \
       --build-arg BUILD={BUILD} .
```

Here are a list of valid values for the parameters:
```
ARCH: armv7hf, aarch64
PY_VERSION: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
BUILD: arm, arm64
```

For example, the following command generates a docker image which contains ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels for Python 3.7 on ARMv7:
```
docker buildx build \
       -t onnx-wheels:armv7hf-3.7 \
       -f onnx.Dockerfile \
       --build-arg ARCH=armv7hf \
       --build-arg PY_VERSION=3.7 \
       --build-arg BUILD=arm .
```

And the following command generates a docker image which contains ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels for Python 3.8 on AArch64:
```
docker buildx build \
       -t onnx-wheels:aarch64-3.8 \
       -f onnx.Dockerfile \
       --build-arg ARCH=aarch64 \
       --build-arg PY_VERSION=3.8 \
       --build-arg BUILD=arm64 .
```

The wheels are located under the `/home` folder of the docker image built in the above step. The wheels can be copied to the host machine by running the appropriate container and using the [`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/) command.

For example, ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels for Python 3.7 on ARMv7 will appear as follows:
```
onnx-1.11.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl
onnxruntime-1.11.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_armv7l.whl
```

And ONNX and ONNX Runtime wheels for Python 3.8 on AArch64 will appear as follows:
```
onnx-1.11.0-cp38-cp38m-linux_aarch64.whl
onnxruntime-1.11.0-cp38-cp38m-linux_aarch64.whl
```
# Test wheels
To test the wheels on ARM32 architecture, launch a Docker instance using the following command and install the desired wheels:
```
docker run --platform linux/arm -it --rm balenalib/raspberrypi3-python:3.7-build /bin/bash
```

To test the wheels on ARM64 architecture, launch a Docker instance using the either one of following commands and install the desired wheels:
```
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -it --rm balenalib/raspberrypi4-64-python:3.7-build /bin/bash
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -it --rm balenalib/aarch64-ubuntu-python:3.7-focal-build /bin/bash
```
